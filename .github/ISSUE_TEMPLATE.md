 - Julia version: [e.g. julia 1.5.3, official binaries from https://julialang.org/downloads/]
 - Do you have Conda installed?
 - Is Conda loaded by default?
 - On windows, what is the output of the command, typed in a [windows shell](https://www.howtogeek.com/235101/10-ways-to-open-the-command-prompt-in-windows-10/): `echo %PATH%`
